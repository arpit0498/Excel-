        Keyboard Shortcuts

If a shortcut requires pressing two or more keys at the same time, keys are separated by a + sign. An exhaustive list of shortcuts is available on the Microsoft Office Support pages. Below are a small number of shortcuts that we have selected to improve your speed and efficiency. The list is by no means exhaustive. If different, Mac shortcuts are listed in second position. For a list of Mac specific keyboard shortcuts see the Microsoft Office ( for Mac) Support page.

Undo/Redo

Possibly some of the most frequently used keyboard shortcuts ever are CTRL+Z and CTRL+Y | CMD+Z or CMD+Y. Z stands for undo and Y for redo. Both operate on multiple levels, meaning that you can go back in time a long way. As always there are of course exceptions to the rule and some actions cannot be undone. In some of these cases, Excel will give you a warning (e.g., deleting a worksheet that has content in it, cannot be undone and Excel will warn you about this) and then there are other events that you cannot undo and no warning message is displayed (e.g. using the 'Move Chart' tool - more on this in Week 6).

CTRL-Y will redo your most recent action which comes in really handy if/when you want to apply a certain step more than once.

New File/ New Workbook

To create a new workbook or new file, you do not need to go into any menu's. You can simply press: CTRL+N | CMD+N

Open file / Open Workbook

To open the dialogue box and select an existing file (workbook) you can use the shortcut: CTRL+O | CMD+O

Close file / Close Workbook

To close your current Workbook, you can click on the 'x' located at the top right (Windows) or top left (Mac), But as shortcut keys are sometimes quicker, you can press: CTRL+W | CMD+W

Save file / Save Workbook

Saving your work regularly should become second nature. This shortcut will help. If you haven't saved your file beforehand, Excel will ask you to assign a name and storage location to your file. If you have, this shortcut will quickly save your file. CTRL+S | CMD+S

Select all

The select all shortcut actually behaves differently based on context. If you are in an empty cell and select all, you will select the entire worksheet. If the active cell contains data that is part of a group (cells containing contiguous data) select all will just select the group of cells instead. You can press it again to select the entire worksheet. The shortcut for select all is: CTRL+A | CMD+A)

Enter a new line of Text

Sometimes when entering data into a cell, you may want to go to a new line below your current one, within the same cell. Rather than let Excel choose when this happens you can use this key press combination to force this behaviour. When editing a cell, press: ALT + Enter

Moving around the worksheet

You can use the arrow keys to move a single cell in any direction. Page Up and Page Down will move one "page" (the number of rows shown on the screen) up or down. CTRL+arrow keys will move to the next blank cell in that direction. If you have a large dataset with no gaps this will move to the edges of the dataset. CTRL+Home takes you to the first cell that contains data in the top-left corner of the sheet. CTRL+End goes to the last cell in the bottom-right. On certain keyboards without a Home key, you might need to use CTRL+Fn+Home to use this shortcut.

Using the keyboard can make your work faster and smoother.

Terminology

Active Cell

The cell in the spreadsheet that is currently selected. It looks like this:

Cell

A cell is at the intersection between a row and a column. A cell is referenced by the column letter and row number. The example below show cell B3:

Fill handle

The fill handle is the small black square on the bottom right-hand corner of the active cell.

You can display or hide the fill handle by:

Click File > Options. In Excel 2007 only: Click the Microsoft Office Button, and then click Excel Options.

In the Advanced category, under Editing options, select or clear the Enable fill handle and cell drag-and-drop check box.

Ribbon

The ribbon is the main menu bar at the top of the Excel screen. The ribbon is several tabs. The HOME tab has some of the most frequently used tools. You can collapse the ribbon to allow more space for the spreadsheet in the main window by double-clicking on any of the tab labels (single-click for Mac users). When you repeat the action, the ribbon will re-appear. Once your ribbon is hidden, you can bring it back temporarily with a single-click, use the tools you needed, and then make it disappear again with another single-click on the tab or anywhere in the spreadsheet.

Row

The rows are counted in numbers. There are 1,048,576 rows in an Excel spreadsheet. You can read more about the specifications and limits of Excel spreadsheets.

Column

The columns are listed in letters. There are 16,384 columns in an Excel spreadsheet. You can read more about the specifications and limits of Excel spreadsheets.

Quick Access Toolbar

The Quick Access Toolbar sits above the ribbon (can also be customized to sit below the ribbon). Tools from any of the ribbon tabs can be added for quick access without switching between tabs.

Status bar

The Status Bar is below the spreadsheet. It contains several useful areas. The Zoom tool, access to three different view options as well as, by default, several calculation results which display dynamically whenever data is selected in the spreadsheet:

Workbook

The term workbook refers to the entire Excel file. The file name of each workbook is at the top of the file window.

Worksheet

A workbook can contain several worksheets. You can add worksheets at the bottom left by clicking on the plus sign next to the last worksheet tab. Right-click on the worksheet tab and you can rename the worksheet and execute a range of other commands.

Ninja Tips for the Week:

Take charge of those endless rows and columns

One of the amazing features of Excel is the sheer endless number of rows and columns. However, sometimes they add to the confusion more than they help. You can actually hide the ones you don't need. Open one of this week's workbooks and try this out step-by-step. Here is how

Select the first column you don't need to see and then press the keyboard shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+right arrow (for Mac use Command+Shift+right arrow). Right-click anywhere in this new selection and select Hide.

Select the first row you don't need to see and then press the keyboard shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+down arrow (for Mac use Command+Shift+down arrow). Right-click anywhere in this new selection and select Hide.

Tada :)

P.S: Just in case you want them back, select the last visible row and drag down into the hidden area, or the last visible column and drag right, and click on Unhide. Everything is back to the way it was.
